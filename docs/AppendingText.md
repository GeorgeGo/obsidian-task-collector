# Append text anywhere

You can define a [task group](README.md#task-groups) named `text` to create a string you can append to any line of text (not just tasks).

This can be useful if you want to configure a quick append string that matches the date format you use for your tasks.

Appending a date and removing matching text work in the same way for both tasks and general text, however, the appended date text is not removed if that line of text is later converted into a task.
